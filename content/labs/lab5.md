# Lab 5: Authentication Vulnerabilities (other authentication mechanisms)

## Objectives
- Learn about vulnerabilities in other authentication mechanisms
- Practice exploiting OAuth, SAML, JWT
- Understand session management vulnerabilities

## Lab Content

- Authorization code interception
- CSRF in OAuth flows
- Open redirect vulnerabilities

### 2. JWT Vulnerabilities
- Algorithm confusion attacks
- Weak signing keys
- None algorithm attacks

### 3. SAML Vulnerabilities
- XML signature wrapping
- SAML response manipulation
- Replay attacks

### 4. Session Management Flaws
- Session fixation
- Session hijacking
- Insufficient session expiration
